## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview of Security and Surveillance Solution

Security and surveillance solution is based on 3 pillars.

1. **Aggregator** – Connects with existing infrastructure. Fetches Camera streams and integrates them in system. A solution can consist of one or more aggregators.

2. **Compute Engine** – Core module responsible for detection and tracking. A solution can consist of one or more compute-engines.

3. **Backend Server** – REST API server which acts as a coordinator and gatekeeper for overall solution

### 1.2 Overview of IoT Solution

#### 1.2.1 Highlights

The rationale behind this IoT Solution for Security Surveillance is to:

1. Video stream from video sources like DVR (Digital Video Recorder) used with CCTV cameras, IP Cameras etc will sent to aggregator.

2. Aggregator will extract frames from the video stream and sends to Compute Engine for detection and tracking. Aggregator also sends these frames to IoThub and back-end server for displaying on the web application.

3. Compute Engine uses deep learning algorithms to detect humans, objects and face recognition. It generates bounding boxes around the detected entity and sends them to the back-end server.

4. Backend server aggregates various micro-services used for different use cases like detection, recognition, tracking and all the required values will be stored in database.

5. On-boarding/Off-boarding of devices/components connecting to wide range of video streams will be controlled using the Web application, web application allow user to select video source, area of interest for detection.

#### 1.2.2 Brief About the Solution

Security and Surveillance is a solution for detection, tracking and recognition of various objects and humans in live or recorded video streams to facilitate the task of surveillance and security involved with it. 

This solution provides base framework for Security and Surveillance (SnS). It is designed in modular way where every involved component acts independently. Due to its independent nature it can be easily tuned to solve problems specific to different domains. E.g. Retail, Security etc.

Security and Surveillance solution can be easily integrated in existing infrastructure (existing camera grid). No additional surveillance hardware is required. It can easily access and connect to existing DVRs to detect and capture stream from connected cameras. It can be configured to connect to IP cameras as well. 

Security and Surveillance will help user to detect and analyses Humans, Objects present in particular area of interest. Humans can be classified based on gender, age group etc. with help of face detection and recognition.  

Security and Surveillance solution can also be used to track and identify humans. It is also possible to track movement across different areas. Admin can view and analyze historical reports based on detection during specified duration.
