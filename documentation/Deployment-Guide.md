## 1 Deployment Guide

This Document explains about how to deploy Security and Surveillance Solution using ARM template. This document shows two different ways of deploying the solution.

•	Using Azure portal

•	Using Azure CLI

This document explains about input parameters, output parameters and points to be noted while deploying ARM template.

## 2 What are Paired Regions

Azure operates in multiple geographies around the world. An Azure geography is a defined area of the world that contains at least one Azure Region. An Azure region is an area within a geography, containing one or more datacenters.

Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography, together making a regional pair. The exception is Brazil South, which is paired with a region outside its geography.

IoT Hub Manual Failover Support Geo-Paired Regions:

## 5 Getting Started

Azure Resource Manager allows you to provision your applications using a declarative template. In a single template, you can deploy multiple services along with their dependencies. The template consists of JSON and expressions that you can use to construct values for your deployment. You use the same template to repeatedly deploy your application during every stage of the application lifecycle.

Resource Manager provides a consistent management layer to perform tasks through Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure portal, REST API, and client SDKs.

Resource manager provides the following feature:

•	Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.

•	Repeatedly deploy your solution through the development lifecycle and your resources are deployed in a consistent state.

•	Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.

•	Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.

•	Apply access control to all services in your resource group because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.

•	Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.
